# Consent Management System (CMS) Project Plan - DPDP Act 2023

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop and implement a Consent Management System (CMS) that ensures compliance with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023. The CMS will empower Data Principals with control over their personal data, provide Data Fiduciaries with the tools to manage consent effectively, and ensure transparency and auditability across the consent lifecycle.  This system will handle consent collection, validation, updates, renewal, and withdrawal, along with cookie consent management, a user dashboard, notifications, grievance redressal, system administration, and comprehensive audit logging.
