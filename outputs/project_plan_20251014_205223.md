## 6. Risks & Assumptions

### 6.1. Explicit Assumptions Made

*   **Assumption 1: Third-party API Availability & Performance:** "Third-party government APIs (for Aadhaar, PAN) will be available and performant with a documented uptime of at least 99.5%."
    *   **Risk:** APIs might not meet performance/availability expectations, impacting core functionality and onboarding time.
    *   **Mitigation:** Obtain formal SLAs, implement real-time monitoring, design robust error handling and retry mechanisms, establish clear communication with API providers, consider manual fallback for critical API downtime.
*   **Assumption 2: Customer Device Access for V-CIP:** "Customers will have access to a device with a working camera and microphone for the Video KYC process."
    *   **Risk:** A segment of customers may lack necessary hardware or technical literacy, leading to drop-offs.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clearly communicate prerequisites, conduct extensive user testing, offer alternative (assisted) onboarding paths, provide troubleshooting guides and customer support.
*   **Assumption 3: Core Banking System (Finacle) API Stability:** "The existing Core Banking System (Finacle) has stable APIs that can be leveraged for integration."
    *   **Risk:** Finacle APIs may be unstable, poorly documented, or lack required functionality, causing integration delays.
    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct early integration Proof of Concept (PoC), assign dedicated CBS team liaison, thoroughly review API documentation, allocate buffer time for integration complexities.

### 6.2. Implicit Project Risks and Inferable Mitigation Strategies

*   **Risk 1: Regulatory Changes:** Changes to Aadhaar e-KYC, PAN verification, or V-CIP guidelines by RBI or other government bodies during the project or post-launch.
    *   **Mitigation:** Design a flexible architecture to adapt to changes, implement ongoing monitoring of regulatory updates, ensure close collaboration with Compliance Officer.
*   **Risk 2: User Adoption/Experience Issues:** Despite design efforts, poor UI/UX or technical glitches could lead to lower-than-expected drop-off rate reduction (KPI-2).
    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct extensive user testing, A/B testing, and iterative design cycles. Ensure the UI is intuitive and responsive across devices.
*   **Risk 3: Data Security Breach:** Handling sensitive customer data (Aadhaar, PAN, V-CIP recordings) poses a significant security risk.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement regular security audits, penetration testing, robust incident response plan, and adhere strictly to RBI's cybersecurity framework (NFR-002).
*   **Risk 4: Underestimation of Operational Team Burden:** The operations team might be overwhelmed by manual reviews for flagged applications, impacting the 15-minute onboarding goal for straight-through processing.
    *   **Mitigation:** Define clear criteria for flagging applications, design efficient review workflows, provide adequate training for the operations team, and monitor manual review volumes.
*   **Risk 5: Integration Complexity with Multiple External Systems:** Integrating with Aadhaar, PAN, CBS APIs, and potentially a V-CIP software can be complex and error-prone.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thorough integration testing, robust API gateways, comprehensive error handling with detailed logging, and early engagement with all external API providers.
*   **Risk 6: Performance Degradation During Peak Loads:** The system might struggle to maintain performance during high user traffic, especially during marketing campaigns.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement load testing, performance testing, and design for scalable infrastructure. The on-premise constraint (Section 5.3) requires careful capacity planning.
*   **Risk 7: Vendor Lock-in or Dependency:** Heavy reliance on specific third-party APIs (Aadhaar, PAN, V-CIP solution) could lead to vendor lock-in or issues if a vendor changes terms or goes out of business.
    *   **Mitigation:** Diversify vendors where possible, ensure robust contracts with clear exit clauses, and design interfaces to allow for swapping out third-party providers if necessary.
*   **Risk 8: Scope Creep:** Despite clear "Out-of-Scope" definitions, stakeholders might push for additional features (e.g., native mobile apps, other product onboarding) during Phase 1.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rigorous change control processes, regularly review scope with stakeholders, and clearly communicate the phased approach.

## 8. Summary

Project Phoenix represents a critical strategic initiative for FinSecure Bank to modernize its retail customer onboarding process. The Business Requirements Document provides a robust and well-defined foundation, detailing clear business objectives, measurable KPIs, and a comprehensive set of functional and non-functional requirements.

The project plan outlined above leverages this foundation, breaking down the complex initiative into manageable epics, detailed user stories with acceptance criteria, and a logical phased approach. Key considerations such as stringent regulatory compliance (RBI), high performance, scalability, and robust security are embedded throughout the plan.

While the project timeline is aggressive with a hard Go-Live deadline of May 1, 2026, the identified risks, assumptions, and dependencies have been analyzed with proposed mitigation strategies. Proactive management of these factors, especially around third-party API stability, internal infrastructure provisioning, and stakeholder approvals, will be paramount to success.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Project Kick-off Meeting:** Formally initiate the project with all key stakeholders, review this project plan, and confirm alignment.
2.  **Detailed Resource Planning:** Allocate specific development, QA, and project management resources to each phase and epic.
3.  **Technical Design Deep Dive:** Begin detailed technical design and architecture sessions, creating low-level design documents.
4.  **Vendor Engagement:** Expedite formal agreements and procurement processes for V-CIP software and finalize API access for Aadhaar and NSDL.
5.  **Infrastructure Readiness:** Collaborate closely with the IT Infrastructure team to ensure environments are provisioned as per the timeline.
