## Feasibility Questions for the Tech Lead

1.  **Integration with External Systems:** What are the proposed methods for other systems (like our client's websites or apps) to connect and exchange consent data with our new Consent Management System, and how will we ensure these connections are secure and reliable?
2.  **Scalability and Performance:** What are our anticipated peak loads for consent requests, user activity, and audit logging, and what architectural approach will we take to ensure the system can handle significant growth and maintain fast performance?
3.  **Data Model and Storage for Granular Consent:** How will we structure and store all the detailed consent information, including different purposes, specific data types, and versioning of consent, to ensure it's accurate, easily retrievable, and compliant with data protection laws?
4.  **Security and DPDP Act Compliance:** What specific security measures will be put in place to protect sensitive personal data and consent records, ensuring full compliance with the DPDP Act's strict privacy and security requirements, including encryption and access controls?
5.  **Reliability of Notification System:** What strategy will we use for sending out user notifications (like email or SMS) and system alerts to Data Fiduciaries and Processors, and how will we ensure these messages are reliably delivered, traceable, and auditable?
6.  **Cookie Consent Implementation:** How will the cookie consent feature be technically implemented and integrated into our various client websites to effectively manage user preferences, detect existing cookies, and ensure a seamless user experience?
7.  **Audit Logging and Immutability:** What system will we use to record all consent-related actions and administrative activities in a way that ensures the logs cannot be tampered with, can be stored for the required long term, and are easily accessible for compliance audits?
8.  **Data Retention and Archiving:** How will the system technically manage the lifecycle of consent data and audit logs, including automated archiving or deletion of old records, to comply with configurable data retention policies and legal requirements?
9.  **User Authentication and Authorization:** What framework will we use to securely verify user identities (Data Principals and administrators) and manage different access levels within the system, especially if we need to connect with existing login systems or identity providers?
10. **Third-Party Dependencies and Risks:** Are there any critical external services or open-source components we plan to use for core functionalities (e.g., identity management, notification delivery, cookie scanning), and what are the potential risks, licensing implications, and integration efforts involved with these choices?
