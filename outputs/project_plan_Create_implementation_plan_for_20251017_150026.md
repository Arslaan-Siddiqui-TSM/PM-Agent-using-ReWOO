**Project Name:** FinSecure Bank Consent Management System (CMS)
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared By:** Senior Project Manager

---

### 1. Project Overview

The FinSecure Bank Consent Management System (CMS) project aims to develop a robust, secure, and user-centric platform to manage the entire lifecycle of personal data consent. This system is designed to ensure strict compliance with the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023**, and the stringent guidelines issued by the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**, particularly concerning sensitive financial and personal customer data (e.g., Aadhaar, PAN, V-CIP recordings).

The CMS will empower Data Principals (customers) with granular control over their personal data, offering transparency and trust. Concurrently, it will provide Data Fiduciaries and Processors (FinSecure Bank and its partners) with the necessary tools and integrations to process consents securely, efficiently, and in full regulatory adherence. The technical architecture will be cloud-native, microservices-based, emphasizing high performance, scalability, resilience, and advanced security measures.

**Key Objectives:**
*   **Comprehensive Consent Lifecycle Management:** Facilitate collection, validation, modification, renewal, and withdrawal of consent.
*   **Data Principal Empowerment:** Provide a user-centric platform for individuals to view, manage, and control their consent preferences and exercise data rights.
*   **DPDP Act & RBI Compliance:** Adhere strictly to the DPDP Actâ€™s regulations, including purpose limitation, data minimization, secure processing, data residency, and RBI's stringent security and auditability requirements for financial data.
*   **Transparency & Auditability:** Ensure all consent-related actions are clearly logged, immutable, tamper-proof, and readily auditable.

### 3. Functional Requirements (User Stories)

#### Epic 1: Consent Management Lifecycle

This epic covers the entire journey of a Data Principal's consent, from initial collection to eventual withdrawal, ensuring compliance with DPDP Act and RBI guidelines for transparency and auditability.

**1.1. Consent Collection**
*   **User Story:** As a Data Principal, I want to easily grant explicit, granular, and purpose-specific consent for my personal data, so that I have full control over its usage and FinSecure Bank complies with the DPDP Act.
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall provide a user-friendly, WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant interface for consent collection.
        *   The system shall require affirmative action for each consent option (e.g., un-ticked checkboxes) and prevent bundled consent for multiple purposes.
        *   The system shall support multi-language display for consent notices and options.
        *   The system shall allow Data Principals to grant granular consent for each specific data processing purpose.
        *   The system shall capture comprehensive metadata for each consent record: User ID, Purpose ID, Timestamp (UTC), Consent Status (Granted/Denied), Language, Initiator, Source IP.
        *   The system shall provide a mechanism for parental/guardian verification for minors' consent.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given a Data Principal navigates to the consent collection interface, When presented with consent options, Then each option for a specific purpose requires an individual, explicit affirmative action (e.g., clicking 'Accept' or checking a box).
        *   Given the consent interface, When the user's browser language is set to a supported language, Then all consent notices and options are displayed in that language.
        *   Given a Data Principal grants consent, When the consent is submitted, Then a new consent record is created in the transactional database (Postgres), including User ID, Purpose ID, current Timestamp, "Granted" Status, selected Language, Initiator (Data Principal), and Source IP.
        *   Given a Data Principal attempting to provide consent for a minor, When the system detects the user is a minor, Then it prompts for parental/guardian verification via a predefined, secure process (e.g., OTP to registered guardian, document upload).
        *   Given a Data Principal grants consent, When the system logs the consent, Then an immutable audit log entry is created with a cryptographic `Audit Hash` for tamper detection, and integrated with the SIEM (Splunk).

**1.2. Consent Validation**
*   **User Story:** As a Data Fiduciary, I want to validate a Data Principal's consent in real-time before processing any personal data, so that I ensure compliance with the DPDP Act and avoid unauthorized data processing.
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall expose a real-time, low-latency API for Data Fiduciaries to validate consent.
        *   The API shall accept User ID and Purpose ID as parameters.
        *   The API shall return whether valid, active consent exists for the specified purpose, and any associated consent terms.
        *   The API shall be secured using TLS 1.2+ and require API key/token authentication (integrated with FinSecure's security frameworks).
        *   The system shall support high transaction volume for consent validation requests (e.g., scaling from 5,000 to 50,000 concurrent requests).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given a Data Fiduciary requests consent validation for `UserX` and `PurposeY` via the API, When valid, active consent exists, Then the API responds within 500ms (target) with a "Valid" status and associated consent details.
        *   Given a Data Fiduciary requests consent validation for `UserX` and `PurposeY`, When no valid, active consent exists, Then the API responds within 500ms (target) with an "Invalid" status.
        *   Given a Data Fiduciary attempts to call the validation API without proper authentication, When the request is made, Then the API returns an "Unauthorized" error.
        *   The consent validation service is deployed as a microservice, leveraging managed Postgres databases with read replicas and client/server caching (Redis) to meet aggressive performance targets.
        *   All API calls to the consent validation service are logged in the immutable audit log with an `Audit Hash`, integrated with SIEM.

**1.3. Consent Update**
*   **User Story:** As a Data Principal, I want to modify my granular consent preferences at any time, so that I maintain dynamic control over my data usage and FinSecure Bank reflects my current choices.
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall provide an interface on the Data Principal User Dashboard to modify granular consent preferences.
        *   The system shall allow Data Principals to update consent for specific purposes independently.
        *   The system shall trigger multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, in-app) to the Data Principal upon a successful consent update.
        *   The system shall trigger secure API-based alerts to relevant Data Fiduciaries/Processors upon a consent update.
        *   The system shall maintain a full, immutable audit log of all consent update actions.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given a Data Principal navigates to their dashboard, When they modify consent for `PurposeA` from "Granted" to "Denied" and save, Then the system updates the consent record for `PurposeA` to "Denied" with a new timestamp.
        *   Given a consent update is performed, When the update is successful, Then an email/SMS/in-app notification (based on user preference) is sent to the Data Principal confirming the change.
        *   Given a consent update for `UserX` and `PurposeY`, When the update is saved, Then the system sends an asynchronous alert via a scalable message queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ) to all subscribed Data Fiduciaries/Processors, detailing the change.
        *   Given a consent update, When the action is completed, Then an immutable audit log entry is created detailing the old and new consent status, User ID, Purpose ID, Timestamp, Initiator, Source IP, and a cryptographic `Audit Hash`.

**1.4. Consent Renewal**
*   **User Story:** As a Data Principal, I want to be reminded to renew time-limited consents, so that I can proactively manage my data processing permissions and avoid service interruption.
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall allow administrators to configure time-limited consent periods for specific purposes via a rules engine (e.g., Drools or custom microservice evaluating JSON-based rules).
        *   The system shall proactively send multi-channel reminders to Data Principals before a time-limited consent expires.
        *   The system shall provide an interface for Data Principals to renew their consent.
        *   The system shall log all consent renewal actions in the immutable audit log.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given a consent for `UserX` for `PurposeZ` is configured to expire in 30 days, When 7 days remain until expiration, Then the system sends a proactive notification (email/SMS/in-app) to `UserX` reminding them to renew.
        *   Given a Data Principal receives a renewal reminder, When they click on the renewal link/button, Then they are directed to an interface to easily renew their consent.
        *   Given a Data Principal renews consent, When the renewal is successful, Then the consent record's expiration date is extended, and an immutable audit log entry is created with an `Audit Hash`.
        *   The consent renewal process leverages the same notification and audit logging mechanisms as consent updates, utilizing Kafka/RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.

**1.5. Consent Withdrawal**
*   **User Story:** As a Data Principal, I want to easily withdraw my consent for specific purposes at any time, so that data processing ceases immediately for those purposes, respecting my rights under DPDP Act.
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall provide a clear and easily accessible interface on the Data Principal User Dashboard for granular consent withdrawal.
        *   Upon withdrawal, the system shall immediately trigger cessation of related data processing by updating the consent status.
        *   The system shall trigger multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, in-app) to the Data Principal upon a successful consent withdrawal.
        *   The system shall trigger secure, real-time API-based alerts to all relevant Data Fiduciaries/Processors upon a consent withdrawal.
        *   The system shall ensure immutable audit logging of all consent withdrawal actions.
        *   The system shall include provisions for legally mandated processing exceptions (e.g., fraud prevention, regulatory reporting as per RBI guidelines) where consent withdrawal may not lead to immediate data deletion.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given a Data Principal navigates to their dashboard, When they select `PurposeB` and click "Withdraw Consent" and confirm, Then the system updates the consent record for `PurposeB` to "Withdrawn" with a new timestamp.
        *   Given a consent withdrawal is performed, When the withdrawal is successful, Then an email/SMS/in-app notification is sent to the Data Principal confirming the withdrawal and its implications.
        *   Given a consent withdrawal for `UserX` and `PurposeY`, When the withdrawal is saved, Then the system sends an immediate, asynchronous alert via Kafka/RabbitMQ to all subscribed Data Fiduciaries/Processors, detailing the withdrawal. This alert system includes circuit breakers and retries with exponential backoff for resilience.
        *   Given a consent withdrawal, When the action is completed, Then an immutable audit log entry is created detailing the old and new consent status, User ID, Purpose ID, Timestamp, Initiator, Source IP, and a cryptographic `Audit Hash`.
        *   Given a Data Principal withdraws consent for a purpose that falls under a legally mandated exception, When the withdrawal is processed, Then the system clearly informs the Data Principal that certain data processing may continue due to legal obligations, and logs this exception in the audit trail.

#### Epic 2: Cookie Consent Management

This epic focuses on providing granular control over website/app cookie preferences to Data Principals, ensuring transparency and compliance with data protection regulations.

*   **User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to manage my cookie preferences with granular control, so that I can choose which types of cookies are used on FinSecure Bank's website/app.

**6.2. Data Retention Policy Configuration**
*   **User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to define and manage data retention policies for personal data and consent artifacts, so that I comply with DPDP Act and RBI guidelines for data minimization and secure storage.
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall provide an interface for administrators to define and modify data retention periods for different categories of personal data and consent records.
        *   The system shall support automated deletion of data and consent artifacts upon expiry of their retention period.
        *   The system shall allow for defining exemptions from automated deletion for legally mandated retention (e.g., financial transaction records, audit logs as per RBI).
        *   The system shall implement secure deletion protocols (e.g., cryptographic shredding for sensitive data where applicable, logical deletion with physical overwrite for storage).
        *   All policy configurations and modifications shall be audit logged.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given an Administrator logs into the CMS admin panel, When they navigate to "Data Retention Policies," Then they can define a policy such as "Consent records related to account opening must be retained for 10 years after account closure, as per RBI guidelines."
        *   Given a consent record expires its retention period and has no legal exemptions, When the automated deletion process runs, Then the consent record is securely deleted from the database and associated object storage (MinIO/S3).
        *   Given a retention policy is configured to exempt audit logs from automated deletion, When the deletion process runs, Then audit logs remain untouched.
        *   Given a retention policy is modified, When the modification is saved, Then an immutable audit log entry is created detailing the policy change, timestamp, and administrator, with a cryptographic `Audit Hash`.
        *   Secure deletion protocols are implemented, including logical deletion from the Postgres database and physical deletion from immutable object storage (MinIO/S3) with WORM policies, ensuring data cannot be recovered.

#### Epic 7: Audit Logging & Tamper Detection

This epic is a foundational, cross-cutting concern ensuring the integrity, transparency, and immutability of all system activities, critical for DPDP Act and stringent RBI auditability requirements.

*   **User Story:** As an Auditor, I want to access a complete, immutable, and tamper-proof log of all consent-related actions and system changes, so that I can verify compliance with DPDP Act and RBI guidelines without any doubt about data integrity.
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall record all critical consent actions (grant, withdraw, update, validate, notification triggers) and administrative actions (role changes, policy updates, data deletions) in a centralized audit log.
        *   Each audit log entry shall include comprehensive metadata: Log ID, User ID (Data Principal or Administrator), Purpose ID, Action Type, Timestamp (UTC), Consent Status (before/after), Initiator (user/system), Source IP, and a cryptographic `Audit Hash`.
        *   The audit logs shall be stored in an immutable, versioned object storage (e.g., MinIO/S3) with WORM (Write Once, Read Many) / retention policies to prevent modification or deletion.
        *   The `Audit Hash` for each log entry shall be cryptographically signed using an HSM-backed key to ensure tamper detection and non-repudiation.
        *   Access to audit logs shall be strictly restricted via RBAC (e.g., only "Auditor" and designated "Admin" roles) and require MFA.
        *   Audit logs shall be integrated with the FinSecure Bank's Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (e.g., Splunk) for real-time monitoring, analysis, and alerting.
        *   The system shall provide tools for auditors to verify the integrity of the audit logs using the `Audit Hash` mechanism.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given a Data Principal grants consent for `PurposeX`, When the action is completed, Then a new immutable audit log entry is created containing all specified metadata, including a unique `Audit Hash`.
        *   Given an audit log entry is created, When it is stored, Then it resides in immutable object storage (MinIO/S3) with a WORM policy, ensuring it cannot be altered or deleted.
        *   Given an attempt is made to modify an existing audit log entry directly in storage, When the system's integrity check (using the `Audit Hash` and HSM-signed metadata) is performed, Then the system detects and flags the tamper attempt, reporting it to the SIEM.
        *   Given an Auditor logs into the CMS, When they attempt to access audit logs, Then they are required to authenticate via MFA and possess the "Auditor" role.
        *   Given an audit log entry is generated, When it is stored, Then it is automatically forwarded to FinSecure Bank's SIEM (Splunk) for centralized monitoring and anomaly detection.
        *   Given an Auditor wants to verify the integrity of a batch of logs, When they use the provided verification tool, Then the tool confirms the cryptographic integrity of each log entry based on its `Audit Hash` and reports any discrepancies.
        *   The `Audit Hash` generation and signing process leverages HSM-backed key storage for maximum security, as specified in the technical solutions, complying with RBI's stringent security requirements.
        *   The audit logging service is implemented as a dedicated microservice, ensuring separation of concerns, high availability, and robustness.
