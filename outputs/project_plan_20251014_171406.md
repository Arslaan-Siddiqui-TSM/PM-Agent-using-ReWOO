# Project Phoenix: Digital Onboarding Platform Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Project Phoenix: Digital Onboarding Overhaul

**Project Goal:** To launch a fully digital, seamless, and compliant savings account onboarding platform by **May 1, 2026**, within a budget of **₹1.5 Crore**, significantly enhancing customer experience, increasing acquisition velocity, reducing operational costs, and ensuring robust regulatory compliance.

**Business Problem:** The current manual, paper-based onboarding process is costly, slow, and error-prone, leading to a high application drop-off rate (over 50%) and competitive disadvantage.

**Key Business Objectives:**
*   **BG-1:** Drastically improve the new customer onboarding experience.
*   **BG-2:** Increase the velocity of customer acquisition.
*   **BG-3:** Reduce operational costs associated with manual onboarding.
*   **BG-4:** Enhance regulatory compliance and reduce manual verification errors.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
*   **KPI-1:** Reduce the average end-to-end customer onboarding time from 72 hours to 15 minutes within 3 months of launch.
*   **KPI-2:** Decrease the application drop-off rate from 50% to below 30% within 6 months of launch.
*   **KPI-3:** Reduce the per-application processing cost by 60% in the first year.
*   **KPI-4:** Achieve a 95% rate of straight-through processing (no manual intervention required) for all eligible applications within 6 months.

**Project Scope (In-Scope):**
*   Development of a responsive web application for new savings account applications.
*   Integration with third-party APIs for Aadhaar e-KYC and PAN card verification.
*   Implementation of a Video Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) module.
*   Digital capture and upload of customer photograph and signature.
*   Automated data validation and verification rules engine.
*   Real-time integration with the Core Banking System (CBS) for instant account number generation.
*   A dedicated portal for the bank's operations team to review and approve flagged applications.
*   Automated SMS and email communication to customers regarding application status.

**Project Scope (Out-of-Scope for Phase 1):**
*   Onboarding for business/corporate accounts.
*   Onboarding for international customers or NRIs.
*   Integration for products other than the standard savings account (e.g., credit cards, loans, fixed deposits).
*   Development of a native mobile application (solution will be web-responsive only).

## 6. Risks & Assumptions

### 1. Risks & Mitigation

*   **Risk 1.1: Third-Party API Unreliability or Changes**
    *   **Description:** External government APIs (Aadhaar e-KYC, NSDL PAN) might be unavailable, slow, or undergo unannounced changes, impacting onboarding and performance targets.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Establish formal SLAs with API providers, implement robust error handling (retry, circuit breakers), develop API monitoring, design fallback procedures (manual review), and use mock APIs for development/testing.

*   **Risk 1.2: Core Banking System (CBS) Integration Challenges**
    *   **Description:** Existing CBS APIs might not be as stable or well-documented as assumed, leading to delays, integration complexities, or performance issues during real-time account generation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Conduct detailed technical assessment and proof-of-concept early, allocate dedicated CBS technical experts, develop comprehensive integration test plans, and maintain strong collaboration with the CBS team.

*   **Risk 1.3: Failure to Meet Performance & Scalability Targets**
    *   **Description:** Ambitious targets (15-minute onboarding, 5-second API calls, 10,000 concurrent sessions) might not be met, leading to poor customer experience and failure to achieve KPIs.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Adopt a performance-driven architectural design, conduct continuous performance/load/stress testing, utilize caching/asynchronous processing/database optimization, and implement robust monitoring.

*   **Risk 2.1: Delays in On-Premise Infrastructure Provisioning**
    *   **Description:** The IT Infrastructure team might not provision and configure required servers by the specified deadline (January 31, 2026), delaying development and testing.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Formalize infrastructure requirements and timelines with IT Infra team, establish regular progress meetings and escalation paths, and consider contingency plans for temporary environments.

*   **Risk 2.2: On-Premise Limitations Hindering NFRs**
    *   **Description:** Hosting strictly on-premise might challenge achieving high scalability (10,000 concurrent users) and availability (99.95% uptime) compared to cloud solutions.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Conduct thorough capacity planning and architectural review for on-premise, invest in robust hardware/network/HA configurations, and ensure IT operations team has necessary expertise.

*   **Risk 3.1: Non-Compliance with RBI Regulations (V-CIP, Cybersecurity, Data Residency)**
    *   **Description:** Failure to fully adhere to RBI guidelines could lead to significant penalties and reputational damage.
