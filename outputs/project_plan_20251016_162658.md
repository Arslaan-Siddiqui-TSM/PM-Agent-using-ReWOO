# Project Phoenix: Digital Onboarding Overhaul - Project Plan

**Project Name:** Project Phoenix: Digital Onboarding Overhaul
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Publication Date:** October 26, 2025 (Updated for Project Plan)
**Status:** Final
**Prepared For:** FinSecure Bank Development Team

## 1. Project Overview

Project Phoenix is a strategic initiative by FinSecure Bank to completely overhaul its customer onboarding process for retail banking. The current manual, paper-based, and time-consuming process leads to high application drop-off rates and significant operational overhead. This project aims to deliver a fully digital, seamless, and compliant onboarding platform accessible via web and mobile browsers. It will leverage e-KYC (Know Your Customer) through Aadhaar, real-time PAN verification, and a video-based customer identification process (V-CIP).

The primary goal is to reduce the average customer onboarding time from the current 3-5 business days to under 15 minutes, significantly enhancing customer experience, reducing operational costs, and ensuring robust regulatory compliance. The project is projected to decrease the customer application drop-off rate by 40% and reduce per-customer onboarding costs by 60% within the first year of implementation.

1.  **High Application Drop-off Rate:** The current manual process leads to "a high application drop-off rate" and "over 50% for applications initiated online."
2.  **Significant Operational Overhead:** The "predominantly manual, paper-based, and time-consuming" current process results in "significant operational overhead."
3.  **Competitive Disadvantage:** "Competitors have already launched digital onboarding solutions, putting FinSecure Bank at a significant competitive disadvantage and impacting our customer acquisition targets."
4.  **High Operational Costs:** The "existing manual onboarding process is costly."
5.  **Slow Process:** The current process is "slow" and takes "3-5 business days," leading to poor customer experience.
6.  **Prone to Human Error:** The manual process is "prone to human error."
7.  **Poor First Impression:** The existing process "creates a poor first impression for new customers."
8.  **Compliance and Audit Trail Challenges:** "Reliance on physical documents presents compliance and audit trail challenges."
9.  **Failure to meet project goals:** If the project fails, it risks not achieving the stated goals of reducing onboarding time, drop-off rate, and costs, or enhancing compliance.

### Potential Challenges

These are difficulties or obstacles that might be encountered during the project's implementation or operation, often implied by requirements, constraints, or dependencies.

1.  **Integration Complexity and Reliability of Third-Party APIs:** The project heavily relies on "integration with third-party APIs for Aadhaar e-KYC and PAN card verification" and "real-time integration with the Core Banking System (CBS)." Ensuring seamless, reliable, and secure integration with these external systems (especially government APIs) is a significant challenge.
2.  **Achieving and Maintaining High Performance:** Meeting the NFR-001 requirement for "All API calls for KYC and PAN verification shall complete within 5 seconds" and the "complete application submission process shall not exceed 15 minutes."
3.  **Ensuring Robust Security and Compliance:** The system must be "compliant with RBI's cybersecurity framework" (NFR-002) and record V-CIP sessions "as per RBI guidelines" (FR-011), requiring continuous adherence to strict regulatory standards.
4.  **Achieving High Scalability:** The system needs to "handle 10,000 concurrent onboarding sessions during peak marketing campaigns without performance degradation" (NFR-004).
5.  **Maintaining High Availability:** The customer-facing application must "maintain an uptime of 99.95%" (NFR-005).
6.  **Adhering to Fixed Budget:** The project has a "fixed budget at ₹1.5 Crore" (Constraint), making cost management a challenge.
7.  **Meeting Tight Deadlines:** The project "must go live by May 1, 2026" (Constraint), requiring efficient project management and execution.
8.  **On-Premise Hosting Complexities:** The solution "must be hosted within the bank's on-premise data center" (Constraint), which can present challenges related to infrastructure setup, maintenance, and scaling compared to cloud solutions.
9.  **Timely IT Infrastructure Provisioning:** The project is "dependent on the IT Infrastructure team to provision and configure the required servers by January 31, 2026" (Dependency). Delays here would impact the project timeline.
10. **Timely Procurement of V-CIP Licenses:** "Successful completion is dependent on the timely procurement of licenses for the V-CIP software solution" (Dependency).
11. **Timely UI/UX Design Approval:** "The final UI/UX design must be approved by the Marketing department before development commences" (Dependency), which could cause delays if not managed effectively.
12. **Customer Device Access for V-CIP:** Ensuring customers have "access to a device with a working camera and microphone for the Video KYC process" (Assumption) could be a challenge for some users, potentially impacting completion rates.

### Underlying Assumptions

These are conditions or beliefs taken for granted for the project to succeed, explicitly stated in the document.

1.  **Third-party government APIs (for Aadhaar, PAN) will be available and performant with a documented uptime of at least 99.5%.**
2.  **Customers will have access to a device with a working camera and microphone for the Video KYC process.**
3.  **The existing Core Banking System (Finacle) has stable APIs that can be leveraged for integration.**
