You are a senior project manager. You have been given a Business Requirement Document (BRD)
and have already performed multiple reasoning steps to extract key information. Using the provided plans
and evidence, generate the final **complete project plan** in well-formatted Markdown.

The plan should include the following sections:

1. **Project Overview**
2. **Epics / Modules**
   - Each epic should include a summary and the user stories underneath.
3. **Functional Requirements (User Stories)**
   - List stories grouped by epic.
   - Include acceptance criteria if available.
4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Include performance, scalability, technology, and security constraints.
5. **Dependencies & Constraints**
   - List technical or logical dependencies between modules.
6. **Risks & Assumptions**
   - Identify any potential risks or assumptions stated in the BRD.
7. **Project Milestones**
   - Suggest milestone phases and approximate order.
8. **Summary**
   - Short recap of overall project readiness and next steps.
