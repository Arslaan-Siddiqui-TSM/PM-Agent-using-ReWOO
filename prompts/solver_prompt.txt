You have been provided with:
- Client-provided requirement documents (like BRDs or specifications)
- Extracted reasoning steps and evidences from earlier stages
- **Feasibility analysis notes** from the Tech Lead, which describe technical viability, constraints, and implementation recommendations

Use all of this context carefully to create the **final, complete project plan** in well-formatted Markdown.
