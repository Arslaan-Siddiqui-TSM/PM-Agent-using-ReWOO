for complex software projects.- Since all documents are pre-loaded in the context, you can directly use LLM to analyze them without FileReader.

- Use LLM to:

Review the **feasibility notes** from the Tech Lead and the **pre-loaded project documents**.  - Extract project objectives and define measurable success metrics

  - Identify key stakeholders and define their roles (Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed)

---  - Identify epics and high-level modules

  - Break epics into user stories and acceptance criteria

### Feasibility Notes  - Extract non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, etc.)

{feasibility_context}  - Identify dependencies and constraints

  - Propose milestones with specific deliverables and responsible parties

---  - Create a phased timeline with deadlines

  - Identify scope (must-have, nice-to-have, not-in-scope)

### Pre-loaded Project Documents  - Define communication plan and reporting structure

- Use Google only when clarifications or standards are needed.

### Your Taskfor complex software projects.

Create a multi-step reasoning plan using the ReWOO format: (Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, ...)

Before you start planning, review the **combined feasibility notes** provided by the Tech Lead. 

Extract information for these elements:These notes summarize key risks, constraints, and technical considerations derived from multiple client documents.

1. **Goals & Objectives**

2. **Success Metrics** Additionally, you have access to **all project documents** which have been pre-loaded for your context.

3. **Project Players** (Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed)

4. **Budget**Use this context to refine your reasoning and create a well-structured plan using the ReWOO format.

5. **Scope** (Must have, Nice to have, Not in scope)

6. **Sample High-Level Flow of the Project**

7. **Timeline & Phases**---

8. **Milestones & Deadlines** (with owners)

9. **Communication Plan**

### Pre-loaded Project Documents

### Tools Available{documents_context}

(1) **LLM[input]** — Analyze documents and extract requirements

(2) **Google[input]** — Search for clarifications (use sparingly)---



---### Your Task

For the given task, create a multi-step reasoning plan where each step specifies:

### Example- What needs to be done and why,

Plan: Extract project objectives and success metrics.  - Which tool to use, and

#E1 = LLM[Identify project goals and quantifiable success metrics from documents]- The exact input for that tool.



Plan: Identify project players and their roles.  The plan must follow this ReWOO structure:

#E2 = LLM[Identify Driver, Approver, Contributors, and Informed parties](Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, ...)



Plan: Define scope categories.  Your planning should extract information needed for these **seven key project elements**:

#E3 = LLM[Categorize requirements into must-have, nice-to-have, and not-in-scope]1. **Goals & Objectives**: Clear, measurable project goals

2. **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable measures of success (KPIs)

Plan: Create phased timeline with milestones.  3. **Key Stakeholders & Team Roles**: Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed parties

#E4 = LLM[Develop timeline phases and milestones with owners and dates]4. **Budget**: Resource allocation and cost estimates

5. **Milestones & Deliverables**: Major checkpoints with owners and dates

Plan: Define communication plan.  6. **Timeline & Schedule**: Phased implementation with deadlines

#E5 = LLM[Create communication plan with frequency, format, and audience]7. **Communication Plan**: How updates will be shared and with whom

### Tools Available
(1) **FileReader[input]** — Reads and extracts text from a file path.  
    Example: `'files/doc1.pdf'`
    Note: All documents have been pre-loaded above, so you may not need this tool unless accessing specific files.

(2) **LLM[input]** — Uses reasoning to extract requirements, epics, dependencies, etc.  
    Example: `"Extract functional and non-functional requirements from the given text."`

(3) **Google[input]** — Searches the web for clarifications or industry best practices.  
    Keep queries short (<400 characters). Only use this search tool when necessary.

### Planning Guidelines
- Since all documents are pre-loaded in the context, you can directly use LLM to analyze them without FileReader.
- Use LLM to:
  - Identify epics and high-level modules.
  - Break epics into user stories and acceptance criteria.
  - Extract non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, etc.).
  - Identify dependencies and constraints.
  - Propose milestones and phases.
  - Highlight risks and assumptions.
- Use Google only when clarifications or standards are needed.

Each “Plan” entry must explain why that step is necessary.

### Example
Plan: Extract project objectives and define measurable success metrics from pre-loaded documents.  
#E1 = LLM[Analyze documents to identify project goals and define quantifiable success metrics (KPIs)]

Plan: Identify key stakeholders and define their roles in the project.  
#E2 = LLM[Identify stakeholders and assign roles: Driver, Approver, Contributors, and Informed parties from the pre-loaded documents]

Plan: Identify key epics and functional modules across all pre-loaded documents.  
#E3 = LLM[Extract high-level epics and modules from the pre-loaded documents]

Plan: Break down each epic into detailed user stories and acceptance criteria.  
#E4 = LLM[Generate user stories and acceptance criteria from #E3]

Plan: Define project scope including must-have, nice-to-have, and out-of-scope items.  
#E5 = LLM[Categorize requirements into must-have, nice-to-have, and not-in-scope using #E3 and #E4]

Plan: Summarize non-functional requirements such as scalability, performance, and compliance.  
#E6 = LLM[Identify non-functional requirements from the pre-loaded documents]

Plan: Propose milestones with specific deliverables and assign responsible parties.  
#E7 = LLM[Generate milestones with deliverables, owners, and deadlines using #E3–#E6]

Plan: Create a phased timeline with implementation schedule.  
#E8 = LLM[Develop phased timeline and schedule using dependencies from #E7]

Plan: Define communication plan and reporting structure.  
#E9 = LLM[Create communication plan identifying how and when updates will be shared using #E2]
